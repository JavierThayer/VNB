# VNB proof checker -- working brief

VNB is a proof checker and more generally a math assistant to help
users discover proofs. It is written in MIT Scheme with a user interface in
GNU/Emacs. Much of the documentation is available using a web
interface. There is also a manual which needs periodic update.  The
logical framework is von Neumann-Bernays set theory but with copious
ready-made constructors. Its research state (what is proven, what is
next) lives in Claude's memory index, not here. This file holds the
operational facts that are expensive to rediscover.

## Running it

    ./prover                  # interactive REPL
    ./prover file.scm         # load a proof script, exit
    ./prover -i file.scm      # load a script, then drop into the REPL
    ./VNB                     # launcher (cold boot re-proves the library: 24 s compiled)
    ./VNB-with-compile        # recompile sources, then launch

Full check suite (distinct from the launcher):

    timeout 900 mit-scheme --quiet --load test-suite.scm < /dev/null

It prints `=== SUMMARY: N passed, M failed ===`.

## COMPILE THE TREE FIRST -- everything below depends on it

`.com`/`.bin` are in `.gitignore` AND excluded from the tarball, so a fresh clone or
unpacked tarball is **interpreted**, and nothing tells you. Compiled vs interpreted, on
this box:

    library load     24 s   vs  ~11 min
    full test suite   6 min vs  ~42 min

Compile once, after a clone/unpack (~10 min, includes one source load):

    ./VNB-with-compile          # or, from a REPL that has loaded load.scm:
    (compile-vnb!)              # incremental: skips files whose .com is fresh
    (recompile-vnb!)            # source-load everything, then compile

If you are ever tempted to conclude "this box is slow", check `ls *.com` first.
`compile-vnb!` skips `*vnb-no-compile-files*` (`driver-kit`, `clobber-guard`: they
capture `(the-environment)`, which compiles WITHOUT COMPLAINT and then reports the wrong
frame) and any file with a top-level `(bc* ...)` (a macro; the .com aborts on load).

After editing a `.scm`, delete BOTH the `.com` and the `.bin`, or Scheme silently
loads the stale binary. `load.scm` names files without extension and prefers `.com`.
(`file-fresh-com?` compares mtimes, so a plain re-save is usually enough.)

**There is no skip-proofs mode.** `VNB_SKIP_PROOFS` was removed (2026-07-09): it had
silently stopped working, and a mode that installs goals as theorems without running their
tactics would give you a library whose `qed` bills read `trust: none` about proofs nobody
checked. Compiling is the honest speedup. If you find the variable named in an old
comment, the comment is stale.

## This box

~3.8 GB RAM (resized 2026-07-08 from 1.9 GB), plus a 2 GB swapfile. One prover run
requests `--heap 120000`, about 1 GB. **Two concurrent provers fit; three do not.**

Never `pkill -f mit-scheme` from a shell command: the pattern matches the killing
command's own command line and takes down the shell (exit 144). A bracket class
(`pgrep -f "[m]it-scheme"`) only saves `pgrep` from matching *itself* -- if the surrounding
shell was launched as `... mit-scheme ...`, `-f` still matches it and you kill your own
shell. Match the executable, not the command line: **`pgrep -x mit-scheme`**.

## Case folding -- the trap that keeps biting

Both the VNB reader and MIT Scheme fold symbols to lowercase. `X` is `x`, `SP` is `sp`.
Three consequences, each of which has cost a debugging session:

1. **Never name a top-level `define` in a proof file like a tactic or a registered
   constant.** `(define BC ...)` rebinds the `bc` TACTIC to a term; the next
   `(bc 'thm)` dies with "The object (...) is not applicable". Real cases: `BC` in
   bordered-eq-border-proof.scm, `TT` in hahn-banach-full-proof.scm and
   nn-least-element.scm, `SP` in a Smith driver, `ID` in mat-equiv-proof.scm.
   Use the file's helper prefix (`ss-`, `bm-`, `cc-`, `hb-`, `me-`). Single/double
   capitals (`BC` `TT` `SP` `NI` `AI` `DI`) are the danger zone. `case-fold-audit` and
   `constant-binder-audit` both inspect WFF binders only, never Scheme defines --
   **`clobber-guard.scm` is the gate that does**: it snapshots every procedure binding
   after `minimize` loads and, after each later file, errors if any was rebound to a
   non-procedure, naming file and symbol. (It found `(define Tm ...)` in
   noetherian-maximal-proof.scm silently killing the `tm` surface helper.) Macros are
   invisible to it -- `environment-lookup` refuses a syntactic keyword, so `bc*` is
   never watched.

2. Structure accessors may inadvertently collide with obvious binder names, but a
   warning is issued (`constant-binder-audit`). `X` used to be a carrier accessor
   and is now `CARR` for algebraic structures, `PTS` for metric spaces (whose
   distance `D` is now `DIST`). Same story for `A`, and for `ID`, now `IDEN`.
   In general avoid single letters -- not a hard and fast rule.

3. Inner binders that would collide take a trailing underscore: `i_`, `j_`, `n_`, `r_`.

## Vocabulary

BONGO refers to a bug, a "tournant dangereux", or an otherwise bad idea.
FUBA, GUBA, RUBA, BLAH etc are generic names.

## Working with the user

Treats Claude as a colleague, and can be ill-tempered at times. Does not
appreciate Claude forgetting previously settled questions. Does not appreciate
gratuitous compliments.

**More interested in technique than in bulk.** One general mechanism that
dissolves a class of obligations beats N bespoke lemmas that discharge them one
at a time. When a proof needs a nasty step, ask first whether the step is an
instance of something the *machine* can do, and only then whether it is a lemma
the PSS should assert. A tactic is untrusted; a support is trusted surface.

## Writing proof drivers

Proof scripts navigate a deduction graph by moving focus between open leaves.

* **Never navigate by goal shape alone.** Sibling branches routinely share a goal head.
  `(forall k. IN k NN => IH => ...)` and a row conjunct `(forall i_. ... => ... => ...)`
  are both `FORALL/IMPLIES/IMPLIES`. Discriminate on the binder, or better, on a
  CONTEXT formula unique to the branch.
* **Never rely on where `ass` or `cut` leave focus.** `cut` opens a side goal plus the
  main branch; the `ass` that closes the side goal hands focus to an engine-chosen leaf.
  Re-focus explicitly afterwards.
* A focus helper that returns `#f` and leaves focus put on a miss will hide all of the
  above for weeks. Make it **error**.
* `fact` peels leading universals and auto-detaches each antecedent already in context;
  it will NOT split a conjunctive antecedent (use backward `bc*` for those). If a `fact`
  seems inert, dump the context and look for the one missing typing hypothesis.
* `detach!` takes the **IMPLIES** formula, not its antecedent. `(detach! <antecedent>)`
  is a silent no-op.
* `mac-h` **replaces** the assumption it unfolds. Unfolding `(IS-IDEAL s I)` to reach its
  closure conjuncts therefore deletes the hypothesis that `ideal-elt-in-carrier` (and
  every other `fact` guarded on `IS-IDEAL`) needs. Get the projection another way, or
  unfold last.
* `minimize!` lands `GUARD[v:=w]` as **one conjunction**, not as its conjuncts. `ai` it
  before detaching anything against it.
* **`cut` of a formula already in context (up to ALPHA) is a silent self-loop.**
  `dg-post!` hash-conses sequent nodes by alpha-equivalence of the assertion plus
  equality of the context, and `context-add-assumption` is alpha-idempotent -- so the
  "main" child of the cut *is* the focus node. One leaf opens instead of two, the graph
  gains a cycle, and the failure surfaces branches later as a missing leaf. Guard with
  `alpha-equiv?` before cutting anything you did not just construct fresh. (This is what
  `minimize!` does; see `mz--cut!` in minimize.scm.)
* `quietly` silences `vnb-guard` as well as `show`, so a tactic that *errors* inside it
  becomes a silent no-op and every later command runs in the wrong branch. A composite
  tactic wants `show` quiet and the guard loud (`mz--quietly`), plus a per-step
  "did this rule fire?" check -- every primitive inference gives its focus node an
  in-arrow, so `(null? (sequent-node-in-arrows n))` afterwards means it did not.
* Debugging recipe that works: `head -N` the proof file into scratchpad, append a dump of
  `(proof-leaves)` with each leaf's goal head and a distinguishing context formula, run it.

## Where a driver helper lives

**Every proof-driving Scheme procedure is either in `driver-kit.scm` -- loaded before any
proof -- or is local to the file that defines it.** There is no third place.

`load.scm` enforces the second half: once `driver-kit` has loaded, each `theorem-library/`
and `calculus/` file is loaded into a fresh `extend-top-level-environment`. A driver's
top-level `define`s stay in its own frame; its `set!` of `*ps*` still reaches the real
binding, and it still sees every tactic, every macro (`bc*`) and everything `driver-kit`
defines. So a stray `(define BC '(succ p))` now breaks only its own file.

Before this, both halves were false and nobody had said so: `proof-leaves` and `any-pred`
were defined *only* inside `theorem-library/nn-least-element.scm` -- a proof script -- and
used by `interactive.scm`, `macetes.scm` and eighteen drivers; `deriv-constant-proof.scm`
exported a thirteen-procedure `dc-` kit to nine drivers, under a comment calling it
"file-local". It worked only because Scheme resolves free variables at call time.

If exactly one file needs a helper, define it there with the file's prefix. If two do, it
belongs in `driver-kit.scm`.

## Layout

    structure-library/   definitions, structures, vocabulary, warranted supports
    theorem-library/     proofs that reach (qed ...); loaded, gated, counted
    calculus/            probes and stress tests; NOT in load.scm
    reference/           GENERATED (PSS.md, THEOREMS.md, ...) -- never hand-edit
    scratchpad/          throwaway drivers (untracked)

**Load order matters.** A file using `sp`/`qed`/`make-wff` must come after `interactive`
and `proof-debt` in `load.scm`. Misplacing it gives "Unbound variable: make-wff".

## Library-build policy

New mathematical facts are added as **warranted supports** (`support` + `warrant!`),
not as kernel axioms -- the ~92 primitive axioms never grow. A `qed` prints its bill:
`proven modulo {...} [trust: ...]`, the set of asserted facts it leans on. `trust: none`
is the strongest tier.

When a proof turns into a grind, that is a finding, not a failure: add the obvious
lemma to the PSS and record the obstacle. Do not slog.

Before adding a support, ask whether it is an *instance* of something a tactic could do.
`minimize!` (minimize.scm) is the worked example: `(minimize! '(v ...) GUARD MEASURE)` =
"choose v satisfying GUARD with MEASURE as small as possible", leaving only the two
obligations any minimization owes -- MEASURE lands in NN, and GUARD is satisfiable. It
turned `min-degree-entry` and `class-min-pivot` from `'well-known` warrants into
theorems. It uses no choice: well-ordering returns a *member* of the value set, which is
a `SEP` set, so `sep-me` recovers the witness.

## Shipping

`~/prover-src.tar.gz` is rebuilt by a Stop hook (`~/.claude/settings.json`): gzipped tar
of `prover/`, no `.git`, no `.com`/`.bin`/`.ext`. That is what "the tarball" means.
